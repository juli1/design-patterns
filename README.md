# Design Patterns examples with various languages
Implementation of design patterns with different languages.
You can find an implementation of design patterns
using C++ and Java.

The following patterns are demonstrated:
 - Singleton
 - Factory
 - Builder
 - Composite
 - Adapter

## General
We start with a basic example with a Car and a Garage.
The garage can contain multiple cars. We have an implementation
of the cars and the garage class in all languages.

The car is an absract class that is later inherited by
other classes. For example, the Car is an abtract
class and then, the CarTesla or CarToyota implements
these class.

## Java

The java/ directory contains an eclipse project. Just
import the project into Eclipse to use the code.

## C++

The c++ directory contains a directory with the code
written in the src/ directory. A Makefile is available
to build the code.
